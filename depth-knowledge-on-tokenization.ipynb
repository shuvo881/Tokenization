2.2. WordPiece\n","\n","Word Piece Tokenization is a method used primarily in natural language processing (NLP) tasks to split text into manageable pieces or tokens. This technique is especially beneficial for dealing with languages that have a rich morphology or for processing text that includes a lot of unfamiliar words or names. The core idea behind Word Piece Tokenization is to balance between the granularity of character-level tokenization and the broader scope of word-level tokenization, effectively improving model performance in various NLP tasks.\n","\n","\n","Tokenization Process:\n","\n","1. Starting Point: Words are first checked against the vocabulary. If a word is found, it is used as a token as is.\n","\n","2. Subword Segmentation: For words not found in the vocabulary, the algorithm attempts to break the word into the largest possible subwords available in the vocabulary. This step is iterated until the whole word is segmented into known subwords or characters.\n","\n","3. Rare Words Handling: The inclusion of characters in the vocabulary ensures that any word, no matter how uncommon or complex, can be tokenized into familiar units, allowing the model to attempt understanding and processing it.\n","\n","\n","Let's consider the word \"unhappiness\" to illustrate the process of WordPiece Tokenization with a more complex example. We'll assume our model's vocabulary includes the following tokens, among others:\n","\n","> un\n","\n","> ##happy\n","\n","> ##ness\n","\n","> happiness\n","\n","Given the word \"unhappiness\", here's how WordPiece Tokenization would proceed:\n","\n","Full Word Matching: The tokenizer first checks if \"unhappiness\" is present as a complete word in its vocabulary. If \"unhappiness\" isn't found as a whole word, the tokenizer moves to break down the word into known subwords or tokens.\n","\n","Subword Segmentation:\n","\n","The tokenizer identifies the prefix \"un\" as a common prefix in its vocabulary, indicating negation or the opposite of the base word.\n","Next, it looks for the longest possible matching sequence that follows \"un\". While \"happiness\" might be in the vocabulary, the tokenizer efficiently breaks down complex words into smaller subwords to maximize vocabulary usage and handle variations robustly.\n","After \"un\", it might identify \"happy\" as a base word. However, since \"happy\" is not standalone in this context, the tokenizer uses the token ##happy to indicate that \"happy\" is part of a larger word.\n","Finally, it recognizes the suffix \"ness\", which is represented in the vocabulary as ##ness to indicate that it's attached to another token.\n","Tokenization Output: Combining these tokens, the process results in the following sequence:\n","\n","> un, \n","\n","> ##happy, \n","\n","> ##ness\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":23,"id":"dfd67ece","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.591837Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.591554Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.597023Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.596343Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.024392,"end_time":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.598815","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.574423","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["with open('/kaggle/input/romeo-and-juliet-tokenization/romeo-and-juliet_tokenization.txt', 'r') as file:\n","    text = file.read()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"id":"e136588a","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.632564Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.63228Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.813477Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.812711Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.200525,"end_time":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.815609","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.615084","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["corpus = text.split()\n","\n","# Tokenize the corpus into words (naive approach for simplicity)\n","words = [word.lower() for sentence in corpus for word in sentence.split()]\n","\n","# Further break down into subwords/characters (naive splitting for demonstration)\n","subwords = set()\n","for word in words:\n","    length = len(word)\n","    for i in range(length):\n","        for j in range(i+1, length+1):\n","            subwords.add(word[i:j])\n","            "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"id":"ba8dcaa1","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.852014Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.851715Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.89101Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.890273Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.059896,"end_time":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.892929","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.833033","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["vocab = {idx: chr(idx) for idx in range(256)}\n","\n","for i, words in enumerate(subwords):\n","    if words not in vocab.items():\n","        vocab[256 + i] = words\n","        \n","with open('word piece vocab.txt', 'w') as file:\n","    file.write(str(vocab))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"id":"839a64a3","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.927396Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.927122Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-27T06:13:12.248376Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-27T06:13:12.247553Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.341074,"end_time":"2024-03-27T06:13:12.250447","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-03-27T06:13:11.909373","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Load Vocab\n","with open('word piece vocab.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n","    data_string = file.read()\n","    vocab = ast.literal_eval(data_string)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"id":"45f9ac83","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-27T06:13:12.285311Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-27T06:13:12.284996Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-27T06:13:12.291477Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-27T06:13:12.290711Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.026022,"end_time":"2024-03-27T06:13:12.293593","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-03-27T06:13:12.267571","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","def encode_text(text, vocab):\n","    #
